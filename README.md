**Fine-Grained Brain-Vision Biometrics via Contrastive Learning**  
(*Preprint, 2025*)

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Fine-grained biometrics seek to distinguish between individuals with highly similar appearances (e.g., pedestrians wearing similar clothing). Traditional methods rely heavily on RGB, infrared, or depth images, which can raise privacy concerns and suffer from performance drops in unconstrained environments.

Electroencephalography (EEG), a privacy-preserving, real-time neural signal, offers a promising alternative. However, its potential for **intra-class fine-grained identification** has been underexplored.

We propose a novel **brain-vision recognition framework** that bridges EEG signals and visual features for fine-grained biometric identification. Our method includes:
- **Advanced EEG Preprocessing**: Stability selection, temporal segmentation, and dimensionality reduction to extract robust neural embeddings.
- **Contrastive Learning**: Align EEG embeddings with visual representations for identity-level discrimination.
- **Neuroscientific Insights**: Analysis of task-relevant brain regions and frequency bands for deeper understanding of biometric decoding.

## ðŸ“ˆ Highlights

- **Three new brain-vision benchmark datasets**
- **Strong performance**: Competitive fine-grained identification accuracy using EEG
- **Neuroscientific findings**: Identification of task-relevant brain regions and frequencies
